# Class 45 Group-A Final Project

This is the final project for the HackYourFuture curriculum we did as a class using the MERN stack by following the agile methodology with our team and a group of mentors. A quick guide to what we built:

## Delivery Application (Just like the others, but better...)
Introducing our revolutionary web app where convenience meets efficiency! Sign up either as a client or a driver to experience seamless delivery services like never before. Clients can effortlessly make delivery requests from one address to another, while drivers stationed at the pick-up address can swiftly accept these requests and ensure timely delivery of packages to their final destinations. Say goodbye to delivery hassles and embrace a streamlined solution with our user-friendly platform.

[Check out our app here!](https://c45-group-a-fa2205e3b8c2.herokuapp.com/)

### What you can do with our app:
1. **Sign up** either as a 'Client' or 'Driver'.
   - If you signed up as a 'Driver':
     1. You can set your status online whenever you want to work.
     2. When you are set online you are eligible to be assigned to a delivery in your town by a client.
     3. You can either accept or reject this delivery after you check the details.
     4. If you accept the delivery you are responsible to take the delivery from the pick-up location to the drop-off location.
     5. You must update delivery status for the client to see on the website (Picked Up-Delivered).
     6. When you are done with the delivery and set it is delivered, you are able to accept other deliveries which are assigned to you.

   - If you signed up as a 'Client':
     1. You can create a delivery request by filling the form.
     2. If you make a mistake with the addresses, our application will be aware of that and it will ask you to check the wrong address (checked by zipcode and house number).
     3. After you created the form you will be able to see the calculated cost of your delivery (Calculated by the size and the distance - automatically calculated distance between addresses by our application).
     4. If you are okay with the cost of the delivery, you will be redirected to the payment page.
     5. If the payment is successful, you will see the list of available drivers in your delivery's pick-up city.
     6. You will see the rating and the other details of the drivers and be able to choose one you want.
     7. If the driver accepts the delivery, he will take it from the pick-up address to the drop-off address.
     8. You will be able to see the current status of delivery (Pending-Picked).
     9. If the delivery is delivered to the address you will be able to set the status as 'Delivered'.
     10. After the delivery is completed you can rate the process.
